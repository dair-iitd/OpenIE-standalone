Open IE 5.1
======
This project contains the principal Open Information Extraction (Open IE)
system from the University of Washington (UW) and Indian Institute of Technology,Delhi (IIT Delhi).  An Open IE system runs over
sentences and creates extractions that represent relations in text.  For
example, consider the following sentence.

    The U.S. president Barack Obama gave his speech on Tuesday and Wednesday to thousands of people.

There are many binary relations in this sentence that can be expressed as a
triple `(A, B, C)` where `A` and `B` are arguments, and `C` is the relation
between those arguments.  Since Open IE is not aligned with an ontology, the
relation is a phrase of text.  Here is a possible list of the binary relations
in the above sentence:

    (Barack Obama, is the president of, United States)
    (Barack Obama, gave, his speech)
    (Barack Obama, gave his speech, on Tuesday)
    (Barack Obama, gave his speech, on Wednesday)
    (Barack Obama, gave his speech, to thousands of people)

The first extraction in the above list is a "noun-mediated extraction", because
the extraction has a relation phrase is described by the noun "president".  The
other extractions are very similar.  In fact, they can be represented more
informatively as an n-ary extraction.  An n-ary extraction can have 0 or more
secondary arguments.  Here is a possible list of the n-ary relations in the
sentence:

    (Barack Obama, is the president of, United States)
    (Barack Obama, gave, [his speech, on Tuesday, on Wednesday, to thousands of people])

Extractions can include more than just the arguments and relation as well.  For
example, we might be interested in whether the extraction is a negative
assertion or a positive assertion, or if it is conditional in some way.
Consider the following sentence:

    Some people say Barack Obama was born in Kenya.

We would not want to extract that `(Barack Obama, was born, in Kenya)` alone
because this is not true.  However, if we have the condition as well, we can
have a correct extraction.

    Some people say:(Barack Obama, was born in, Kenya)

## Improvements over Open IE 4.0

Firstly, Open IE 5.1 improves upon extractions from numerical sentences. For example, consider the following sentence.

    Barack Obama is 6 feet tall.

Open IE 5.1 gives the following extractions:
    
    (Barack Obama, has height of, 6 feet)
    (Barack Obama, is, 6 feet tall)

Open IE 5.1 can also extract implicit numerical relations from units in sentences. For example, consider the following sentence.

    James Valley has 5 sq kms of fruit orchards.
    
The extractions are the following:

    (James Valley, has area of fruit orchards, 5 sq kms)
    (James Valley, has, 5 sq kms of fruit orchards)
    

Secondly, Open IE 5.1 improves upon conjunctive sentences by breaking conjunctions in arguments to generate multiple extractions. For example, consider the following sentence.

    Jack and Jill visited India, Japan and South Korea.
    
Open IE 5.1 gives the following extractions:

    (Jack, visited, India)
    (Jill, visited, India)
    (Jack, visited, Japan)
    (Jill, visited, Japan)
    (Jack, visited, South Korea)
    (Jill, visited, South Korea)

## Research

Open IE 5.1 is the successor to Open IE 4.x and Open IE 4.x is the successor to [Ollie](http://www.gitub.com/knowitall/ollie).
Open IE 5.1 improves extractions from noun relations([RelNoun](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mausam/papers/akbc16.pdf)), numerical sentences([BONIE](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mausam/papers/acl17.pdf)) and conjunctive sentences([CALMIE](http://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~mausam/papers/coling18.pdf)). Whereas Ollie used bootstrapped dependency parse paths to extract relations (see [Open Language Learning for Information Extraction](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mausam/papers/emnlp12a.pdf)), Open IE 4.x uses similar argument and relation expansion heuristics to create Open IE extractions from SRL frames.  Open IE 4.x also extends the defintion of Open IE extractions to include n-ary extractions (extractions with 0 or more arguments 2s).

## Building

First, download the standalone jar for BONIE from [here](https://github.com/dair-iitd/OpenIE-standalone/releases/download/v5.0/BONIE.jar) and place it inside a `lib` folder(create the `lib` folder parallel to the `src` folder).

Also, download the standalone jar for CALMIE from [here](https://github.com/dair-iitd/OpenIE-standalone/releases/download/v5.0/ListExtractor.jar) and place it inside the `lib` folder.

CALMIE uses Berkeley Language Model. Download the Language Model file from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-5EkZMOlIt2cFdjYUJZdGxSREU/view?usp=sharing&resourcekey=0-X_oNJ6r24s_anMGbKKRdQw) and place it inside a data folder(create the `data` folder parallel to the `src` folder)

`openie` uses java-8-openjdk & the [sbt build system](http://www.scala-sbt.org/), so downloading
dependencies and compiling is simple:

1. Add sbt/bin to your path.
2. Run compile.sh

Open IE uses scala 2.10.2. In case of a version mismatch problem, try using Scala 2.10.2.

## Using pre-compiled OpenIE standalone jar

If you are unable to compile the jar locally on your machine, you can directly use the jar from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19z8LO-CYOfJfV5agm82PZ2JNWNUPIB6D/view?usp=sharing). Note that you would still need the Language Model file and Wordnet folders in the correct locations.

This jar has been compiled on an ubuntu machine. Thus, it might not work if there's a platform (or version) change, in which case it is recommended to build the jar locally.

## Running

You can run `openie` with sbt or create a stand-alone jar.  `openie` requires
substantial memory.  `sbt` is configured to use these options by default:

   -Xmx10G -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC
   
OpenIE's large memory requirements largely accounts to the fact that it currently uses Berkeley Language Model in the background.

### Running with sbt

For running without jar:

    sbt 'runMain edu.knowitall.openie.OpenIECli'

### Running from a stand-alone jar.

First create the stand-alone jar.

    sbt clean compile assembly

You may need to add the above memory options.

    sbt -J-Xmx10000M clean compile assembly

Then you can run the resulting jar file as normal.

    java -jar openie-assembly.jar

You may need to add the above memory options.

    java -Xmx10g -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -jar openie-assembly.jar
    
The WordNet folder and the data/languageModel file must be placed parallel to the standalone openie jar, while running it.

### Running as HTTP Server

OpenIE 5.1 can be run as a server. For this, server port is required as an argument.
    
    java -jar openie-assembly.jar --httpPort 8000
    
To run the server with memory options.

    java -Xmx10g -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -jar openie-assembly.jar --httpPort 8000
    
To get an extraction from the server use the POST request on '/getExtraction' address. The sentence will go in the body of HTTP request. An example of curl request.

    curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/getExtraction -d 'The U.S. president Barack Obama gave his speech on Tuesday to thousands of people.'
    
The response is a JSON list of extractions.
    
### Running with Python

Python Wrapper for OpenIE 5.1, along with instructions and examples can be found [here](https://github.com/vaibhavad/python-wrapper-OpenIE5)

### Command Line Interface

`openie` takes one sentence per line unless `--split` is specified.  If
`--split` is specified, the input text will be split into sentences.  You can
either pipe input from Standard Input, specify an input file (an option first
argument), or type sentences interactively.  Output will be written to Standard
Output unless a second option argument is specified for an output file.

`openie` takes a number of command line arguments.  To see them all run
`java -jar openie-assembly.jar --usage`.  Of particular interest are
`--ignore-errors` which continues running even if an exception is encountered, `--binary` which gives the binary(triples) output and `--split` which splits the input document text into sentences.

There are two formats--a simple format made for ease of reading and a
columnated format used for machine processing.  The format can be specified
with either `--format simple` or `--format column`.  The simple format is
chosen by default.
